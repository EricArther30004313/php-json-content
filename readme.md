# Cars Array

The cars_array.php file shows a multidimensional array of cars and each index contains a string and another array displaying a make and 5 models.
The output on the HTML is to show the make in an H2 tag and an unordered list for the models.

# Cars.php and carsoop.php

This is the same thing as above, but it is refactored to have a PHP class of a car which has a function build in and multiple instances are created which can be looped over.
